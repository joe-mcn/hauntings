            <p class="lead">The Simpson Ghost Hunters investigate haunted locations and paranormal activity around the Simpson College campus. These experiences are real and can be backed up with witnesses and evidence. Our hunters have spent hours on lockdown inside these locations and are trained to defend themselves from the paranormal. Due to the unpredictable nature of these anomalous creatures, we highly advise that you never try this alone.</p>
